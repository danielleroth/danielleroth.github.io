            <h3>Education & Experience</h3>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate from Eastern Washington University, where I earned my BA in Visual Communications Design, and my Minor degree in Art. My experience as a student has been a great launching point from which to be introduced to the world of design, as well as to be propelled into challenging myself and growing as a designer. </p>
            <p>As a student at EWU, I had the privilege that a large portion of my educational experience was spent working frequently in teams, as well as experience working directly with local business owners as clients. Both of these components in my education have, in my opinion, contributed greatly in providing hands on experience. Learning to operate under deadlines, communicating and operating as a team on projects, and having client interaction through a project's initiation and completion are all essential experiences in my development as a designer.</p>

      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>I'm a visual communication designer, proudly graduated from Eastern Washington University. Visual design is my passion, as well as my career path. </p>
            <p>I believe that every design project can really be viewed as a complex and exciting puzzle. I am passionate about making designs which clearly communicate strong and helpful ideas that people should hear. Whether that's how a company can help the average person, or generating awareness through visual campaigning about social issues, visual communication is a versatile and deeply powerful tool to share ideas with people.</p>
