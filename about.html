            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>I'm a visual designer, illustrator, and photographer, proudly graduated from Eastern Washington University. Visual design is my passion, as well as my career path. </p>
            <p>I believe that every design project can really be viewed as a complex and exciting puzzle. I am passionate about making designs which clearly communicate strong and helpful ideas that people should hear. Whether that's how a company can help the average person, or generating awareness through visual campaigning about social issues, visual communication is a versatile and deeply powerful tool to share ideas with people.</p>
